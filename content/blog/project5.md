Explore the user journey within the Nutrition Guide application:

- Nutrient Selection: Users select their desired nutrient from a drop-down menu within the web application.

- Nutrition Query: Upon selection, the application processes this input and searches its database to identify the top 10 foods that are highest in the chosen nutrient.

- Results Display: The web application then displays a detailed list of these top 10 foods, providing users with valuable information about their nutrient content.
