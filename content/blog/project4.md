This research project studies the variations in criminal trial rates on jury trials in felony cases for counties in North Carolina. Here is the link: [Project Link](https://github.com/JiayiZhou36/Fall2022_Statistics_CapstoneProject).

### Project Background
* Jury trials in criminal courts in the U.S. have suffered through blight for many years.
* The jury trial rate is an important component of a healthy criminal legal system.
    * Keep prosecutors accountable to the law and community values
    * Promote more awareness of the criminal courts and acceptance of their legitimacy
* If jury trials are too few, then a court system faces the danger of being considered illegitimate.

### Project Goal
1. Understand and describe the variations in criminal trial rates among counties in North Carolina over ten years with maps
2. Explain the variations in criminal trial rates among counties in North Carolina with models

### Conclusions
* From looking at the three models, the Mixed Effects Model proved the best for understanding the variation in the data and interpretation. We could fix the county instead of worrying about 100 different indicator variables that proved to have varying levels of significance.
* Based on the three models, we conclude that Acquittal Rates, Judicial District, Percent of the population that is Black, Percent of the population that is Hispanic/Latino, and Volume of Cases in the County are related to the variations in criminal trial rates among counties in North Carolina.
* Based on the Mixed Effects Model, Acquittal Rates and Percent of the population that is Black have the two highest values in coefficients to predict the variations in criminal trial rates among counties in North Carolina.
