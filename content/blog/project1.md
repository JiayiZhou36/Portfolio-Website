In this project, we have created a model to assist in setting prices for Airbnb listings in Asheville, NC. The model utilizes log-transformed variables, including price, distance to downtown, and minimum number of nights for the listing, achieving a root mean square error of 0.40 and an R-squared value of 0.53. Here is the link: [Project Link](https://github.com/JiayiZhou36/Fall2023_IDS702_IndividualAnalysis_1).
