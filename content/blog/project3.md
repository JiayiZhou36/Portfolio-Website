This is for class database management systems final project. The project revolves around enhancing the database system for "Friendly Cars," a dealership, and developing a user interface to improve data management and reporting. The current system contains information on cars, customers, salespeople, and sales transactions, but it needs to be made more efficient and capable of generating specific reports. The project includes the following key components:
* Database Enhancement: The objective is to create a more efficient database system that can store additional data and generate specific reports. The new database will be designed to add data seamlessly and generate reports.
* User Interface: A user-friendly interface is being developed to allow users to interact with the database without requiring knowledge of the underlying structure. This interface is primarily intended for use by car shop employees and will facilitate data input and retrieval.
* Database Connectivity: Employees can access the database through either MySQL or the provided user interface. The user interface is designed to run with a Python command, making it accessible for users to view and insert data.
* Technologies Used: The user interface is developed using PyQt5 and MySQL connector. PyQt5 was chosen for its versatility and the ability to create large-scale GUI-based applications. This choice ensures that users can easily expand upon the existing program with abundant resources for learning.
* Report Generation: The user interface allows users to generate reports by running the Report.py file and using buttons in the interface. These reports include information about employees, available cars, customers who have made purchases, customers who have not made purchases, and sales reports.
* Data Insertion: The user interface also facilitates the input of new data, including car information (e.g., car ID, features, manufacturing details), customer information (e.g., customer ID, name, purchase status), and employee information (e.g., employee ID, name, role) as needed.
